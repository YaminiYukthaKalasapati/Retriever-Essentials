Syna Solutions
Project Overview
Syna Solutions is a Django-based web application designed to handle various functionalities such as inventory management, user authentication, and session management. The application follows a modular structure, making it easily extensible for future features like role-based access control, advanced search functionality, and integration with other services.
This project is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. The application leverages Django's built-in authentication system, CSRF protection, and reusable templates to ensure both security and usability.

Detailed Explanation of Key Files
inventory/ Directory
This directory contains the core application for managing inventory and associated views.
•	models.py: Defines the database schema for inventory items. It includes fields like name, description, quantity, price, etc.
•	views.py: Contains functions to handle the logic for rendering templates and processing user input. Views like adding inventory items or displaying the inventory list are defined here.
•	forms.py: Contains Django forms for validating and handling user inputs, such as adding new inventory items.
•	urls.py: Maps URLs to views in the inventory app, such as /inventory/add/ or /inventory/search/.
•	templates/: Contains HTML files that render the pages. This includes templates for adding inventory, admin dashboard, login pages, and search results.
•	staticfiles/: Stores static files like images, CSS, and JavaScript, used for styling and dynamic features like barcode scanning.
________________________________________
syna_solutions/ Directory
This directory contains global settings and configurations for the entire project.
•	settings.py: Contains global settings such as database configurations, middleware settings, and third-party library settings. It also includes important security settings like CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS, ALLOWED_HOSTS, and static file configuration.
•	urls.py: Defines the root URL patterns and routes the requests to the appropriate apps, including inventory and others.
•	asgi.py and wsgi.py: Entry points for asynchronous (ASGI) and synchronous (WSGI) deployments, respectively.
manage.py
This is the primary command-line tool for managing your Django application. You can run commands like runserver, makemigrations, and migrate through this file.

Features
Inventory Management
The inventory module allows users to manage the stock of products, including adding, editing, and deleting items. Each inventory item includes fields like name, description, and price, and can be updated by the admin.
Custom Authentication
The project includes custom login pages for both general users and admins. The admin login page includes additional CSRF protection to safeguard against unauthorized access.
CSRF Protection
The project uses Django's CSRF middleware to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. CSRF tokens are automatically added to all forms that modify data, such as login and inventory management forms.
Reusable Templates
Templates like home.html, inventory.html, and admin_dashboard.html are designed to be reusable and extendable for future pages or features. This makes it easy to add more views in the future without modifying the core layout.
